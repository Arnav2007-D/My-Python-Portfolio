#Project: Arnav Timer
- A lightweight Python script that automatically creates secure, randomly generated passwords using letters, numbers and characters. Built to improve my understanding of Python’s random and string modules while creating something practical for everyday use.
## Features
- Generates completely random passwords of any length.
- Uses a mix of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Lets you keep generating new passwords in one session.
## How it works
- User enters the desired password length.
-  It picks random characters from that pool until reaching the chosen length.
-  Displays the new password, and gives two options.
## What i learned
- How to use random.choice() to select random values from a list or string.  
- Working with Python’s built-in string constants like ascii_letters, digits, and punctuation.
##Future Improvement
-  Integrate a password strength meterthat analyses randomness.
-  Add a feature to copy the password directly with one key press.

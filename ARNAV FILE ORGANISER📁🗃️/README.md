#Project: Arnav File Organiser

 A simple and fun Python script made by a **Year 12 student** who’s tired of cleaning messy folders manually. It automatically organizes your files into subfolders based on their type. 

##  Features

- Sorts files by their extension (like .jpg, .pdf, .exe)  
- Won’t delete or overwrite anything — just moves files safely  
- Beginner‑friendly code — short, clean, and well‑commented  

## How it Works
- Enter a folder path - Documents, Downloads, Desktop
- The program checks all files in that folder.
- It organises them after clicking what path. Making your life a million times better 😇
## Learnt 
 - How to use **`pathlib`** to scan folders and check file types.
 - Validating paths and handling user input properly.
 - Writing cleaner and more organized Python code using functions and loops.
## Future Improvement
  - Implement a feature to **undo or restore** the organisation
  -  Add error handling for invalid or restricted folder paths.

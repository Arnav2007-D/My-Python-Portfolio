# Project: Arnav' Quiz
  - This project presents a brief overview of my main interests and key aspects of my life, highlighting my aspirations, future goals, and passions.
## Features
  - Multiple-choice quiz: Users answer 5 questions about my life, each with three options.
  - Immediate feedback: After each answer, the program tells the user if they were correct and shows the correct option if they were wrong.
  - Score calculation: It calculates the final score as a percentage based on how many questions the user got right.
## How to run
  - Use python.org or another code program.
  - run 'python Arnav's Quiz.py'
## How it works
  - The questions, options, and correct answers are stored in lists/tuples at the top of the code.
  - A loop goes through each question, shows its three options, and asks the user to type A, B, or C.
  - For each question, the code compares the user’s choice with the correct answer and adds 1 point if it’s right.
  - At the end, it calculates the percentage score and prints all the correct answers and the user’s guesses.
## What I learned
  - This further strenghtened my knowledge on conditional, it uses an if and else check to see if the user’s answer matches the correct one.
## Improvement
  - do a better job making the conditional statements more functional.

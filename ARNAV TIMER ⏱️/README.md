#Project: Arnav's Timer LETS GOOOO!!!
- A simple Python timer I built to practice working with loops, time formatting, and user input. It lets you enter hours, minutes, and seconds, then displays a live countdown right in the terminal.
##Features
- Displays formatted (HH:MM:SS)** as it counts down.  
- Accepts hours, minutes and seconds as input.  
## How it works
-  The user enters how long they want the timer to run (hours, minutes, seconds).  
-  The program converts everything into **total seconds**.  
-  It loops until the countdown hits zero, updating every second.
##Future Improvement
- Add music when the time ends.
-  Add study timer mode with work/break cycles.
## What I learned
- Efficiently updating printed lines in the terminal (end="\r").
- Error handling for incorrect user input.

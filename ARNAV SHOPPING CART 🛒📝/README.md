# Grocery Cart App

Simple console app to add grocery items with prices and calculate total.

## Features
- Add unlimited grocery items with prices
- View complete cart with individual prices
- Automatic total calculation
- Clean exit with ENTER prompt

## How it works
- Two parallel lists: foods (names) + prices (costs)
- Loop: add item/price or exit to cart view
- zip() pairs items with prices for display
- sum(prices) calculates total

## What I learned
- Parallel lists for related data
- zip() for pairing lists
- sum() for list totals
- float() input for prices

## Improvements
- Input validation for numbers
- Clear cart option
- Saveand load cart to file
